# Project Title

>Description:This application is one of my personal favorites. A full stack note app that with a twist that promotes mental health. Using the MERN stack to build this beautiful app was a challenging yet rewarding expereince. From setting up the REST Api to adding the last front end feature I can say there was not a moment I wasn't excited to completed this!


## Features

>Some unique features to this app are simple in nature in terms of technological implementation and were made that way to encourage simplicity. 
The first unique feature is the ability to define each emotion. This feature is simply a state change in React but essentially offers people the ability to break down complex emotions into simple ones by defining it more. With the same functionality there is a quote that is shown for every word to help create a deeper understanding to the word itself. Each and every definition and quote was handpicked to the best of my ability and i'm sure there is room for growth there but I was pretty happy about what I ended up with.

## Example Code

>Show what your code does as concisely as possible. Users should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the example.
>Also include the example code as a file in your repo (named `example.js` or in an `example` directory) so that users can run the code if they clone down the repository.

## The Why

>The reason why I developed this note app was because I am currently in the mid stages of my self taught developement journey and needed to work on an application that I was passionate about. The idea came from my unending interest in bettering mental health in myself and my community. I've realized over the years that there aren't a lot of applications helping people with breaking down difficult problems into simpler more understandle ones and one of the biggest problems i've seen in a lot of areas of life is communicating ones emotions. Whether that's with someone else or themself, that information isn't usually readily available to people or even thought about. With this app you are able to not only learn more about how you feel but keep track of it in a notes. With a simple feature based on a well known tool used in therapy, the emotion wheel. I hope that with this as a starter point I can truly start building more applications that could help people navigate a mindful approach to understanding their emotions and help bring clarity and understanding to how they feel from day to day.
